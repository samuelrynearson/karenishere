    We are all different but the same <br><br>

    By transferring schools Karen, she noticed her behaviour changing. she was picking up different items of clothing  to put on unconsciously in order to fit in to the new environment even though she is a fashion designer.
    There are many ways to make connection with people. Some people use alcohol, some people use drugs, some people use music, in the same time I wonder if dressing is also a way for people to connect with each other.
    By taking pictures from both Art schools to discover the relationships of collective identity and individuals, using the common “hip” elements as references.
    The urge of making connection can lead to the addiction behaviours; the textile in the collection translates the feeling of addiction. Together with the research of “hip” elements and the manipulated textile, compose the collection.
