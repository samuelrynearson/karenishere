        Boy please cry <br><br>
        Girls fight for their equality, the thing girls want to change is the point of view of boys.<br><br>
        If you want people to listen you, you need to listen to them first.<br><br>
        Boys feel intimidating by feminism because they think girls want to take something away from them.<br><br>
        Boys are not allow to easily show their emotion, they donâ€™t wear skirt like how we wear trousers.<br><br>
        Girls think in order to improve the real equality we need to free the boys first.<br><br>
        So boy please cry.
